# DCAFood App

DCAFood is an iOS app built using the MVVM pattern combined with an observer for data binding and a coordinator for navigation. This document provides an overview of the design decisions, areas for improvement, and the readiness of the app for submission to the App Store.

## Design and Architectural Patterns

The decision to use the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern was based on the following factors:

1. Separation of concerns: MVVM promotes a clear separation between the user interface, data presentation logic, and business logic, making the codebase more organized and easier to maintain.
2. Testability: MVVM enables better unit testing by isolating the ViewModel, which contains the app's presentation and business logic.
3. Data binding: The observer pattern for data binding allows for automatic UI updates when the underlying data changes, reducing boilerplate code and simplifying the view.

The coordinator pattern was chosen for handling navigation as it helps to:

1. Decouple view controllers, making them more reusable and independent.
2. Centralize navigation logic, providing a clear entry point for navigation-related code.
3. Improve testability by enabling the isolation of navigation-related code during testing.

## Areas for Improvement

The following parts of the app could benefit from more development time or improvements:

1. Error handling: Implement more robust error handling, including user-friendly error messages and fallback strategies in case of network issues or service unavailability.
3. Expand app features: Introduce more functionality, such as user authentication, social sharing, or integration with other services and APIs.

## Favorite Part of the App

The combination of the MVVM pattern with the observer pattern for data binding is particularly appealing. This approach results in a clean, well-organized codebase that is easier to maintain and test. Additionally, it simplifies UI updates and promotes reusability of view components.

## Open Issues and Missing Features

The following items are currently missing or open in this assignment:

1. UI tests to cover all app components and user flows.
2. Caching for opened items.
3. Error handling as mentioned before.
